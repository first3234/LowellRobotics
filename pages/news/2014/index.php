<p>This time we did similar to Gull Lake, not achieving the same level of victory as we did last year for GVSU. Due to some robot trouble, in the alliance selection we were seeded 14 and, thankfully, picked by the eighth seeded alliance. In the first quarterfinals match we saw we needed all teams working together for points, losing 74-211. Next match we decided to pass when we blocked, but that did not prove as well as we hoped. Once again, we lost 88-157.</p>

<p>The Gull Lake Competition made us believe we would make states. We went into the elimination matches and sailed through the quarterfinals, 115 to 98 and 157 to 138. The semifinals had a small amount of surprise. The first match we won 105 to 86. However, the opposing alliance reviewed and improved their strategy. They pulled it closer but we still proved victorious, 106 to 96, and sealed our place in the finals. The final opposing alliance was clever, for they blocked us two at a time. This may have been the factor in making us lose, 67 to 190. Our alliance decided upon a new strategy, to increase our chances, but still lost 73 to 195. In the end, we received a finalist medal and the Engineering Quality Award, thanks to our sponsor Mr. Pete Odland (CEO of Whites Bridge Tooling Inc.)</p>
