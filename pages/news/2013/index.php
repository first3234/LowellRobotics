<p>At the GVSU competition we did terrific, going almost undefeated (having four losses). We only lost two matches in qualifications and, in the elimination matches, sailed on to the final match against the number one seeded alliance. We pulled the two finals matches close, but lost by a small amount. At this competition we received finalist medals and an award for Industrial Design due to our CNC Machining and Arrow holes.</p>

<p>	At States we, sadly, did not do the same outstanding job as in GVSU. However, that was due to countless problems, with some given life by other problems. Most of them had, in some way shape or form, to do with the wear and tear our robot received. In States we did not place for the elimination matches, but enjoyed it nonetheless.</p>
