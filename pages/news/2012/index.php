</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">December 26, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season has come to a close, and <a href="http://firstinmichigan.us/FRC_2012/2012_Results.xls">state rankings</a> show us in eighteenth place!
We were waitlisted for the World Championship, and ended up being one match win away from going. With the new season rapidly approaching, we are working hard to prepare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="http://firstinmichigan.us/FRC_2012/2012_Results.xls">state rankings</a> show us in tenth place! We are officially qualified
for state championships. We are working to prepare ourselves for the state competition. Our autonomous mode will hopefully keep us highly ranked throughout next week's
competition.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">March 18, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued our no fixes necessary streak this weekend. We adjusted our ball pickup mechanism and arrived with an upgraded bridge
manipulator. After seeding third, we were selected by the number 2 seed. Our alliance was eliminated in the quarter finals. Our team received another award this weekend:
the Motorola Quality Award. With the points we scored this weekend we will most likely be in the top 20 Michigan teams.</p>

</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">March 10, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience at Traverse City was new to us because we didn't have to stay late in the pits fixing the robot. Our first day of competition
left us with a record of 6-1-1. Our second day of qualification matches left us with a record of 8-2-2 and a rank of 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During alliance selection, we were asked by team #4003 from Allendale to be on the second alliance; we accepted. After some deliberation, we
chose team #3509 from Niles. We won both quaterfinal matches against the 7th alliance. In the semi-finals, we faced the 3rd alliance, and won after two matches. In the
finals, we lost the first match, won the second match, and, with #3509 a little broken, won the third match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the award ceremony, we were given the Engineering Excelence Award, sponsored by Delphi. One of the trophies will go to White's Bridge
and some of our other sponsors. The banner that we won for our first place victory will be placed in our showcase in LHS.</p>

<h2 id="newstitle">Code Red Practice</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">February 20, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to the practice hoping to learn from the other teams and test our robot as well as we could. Along the way, we got to work with the
other teams and had a lot of fun. Thank you to Code Red FRC #2771.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practicing we found that the robot was a little too tall, so White's Bridge volunteered to make parts to shorten the tower. This change
will increse stability and prevent us from holding more than three balls.</p>

</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">February 13, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our robot is now functional. On Saturday the final assembly of the tower was completed. There are some tweaks that need to be made to
improve stability and some sensors need to be added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, the programming team tweaked the code to get all of the motors to be in sync with the controls. We can now compete at a basic
level. In the next week, the programmers hope to implement the vision tracking and to make the robot autobalance. Autonomous will follow soon after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team is now actively working to put together our scouting system for this year. We have enough members this year for a great scouting system
and a full pit crew.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">February 9, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three builds, we have come a long way. The robot now has almost every component attached. It looks gorgeous with the red
anodizing. Thanks to <a href="http://www.wbtooling.com">Whites Brige Tooling</a> for their construction of the necessary parts. On Saturday the 11th, the assembly will
be completed with the modified rack and pinion system and the attachment of the screw drive to the motor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programming has come a long way as well. On Saturday, we were all a little panicked because the signal light wouldn't come on. Thanks to
the people at cheif delpi, the problem, a bad DB37 ribbon cable, was fixed. After a programming meeting on Sunday, all of the controls have basic functionality, we can
run every motor, get every input, and display the current operations to the SmartDashboard. On Monday and Wednesday, the camera was fixed so that the IP address is now
10.32.34.11 with the appropriate username and password; the dashboard still isn't getting images, but we'll fix that. Finally, all of the motor saftey errors have been
fixed by adding variables for each motor and setting them to 0.0 every loop (unless we need to set them otherwise.)</p>

<h2 id="newstitle">Build #11</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">February 1, 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday's build was an eventful one and ended up being one of the more productive builds we have had so far.
We had small teams practicing with the robot, others programming, and still others setting up the new robot. Our team as a whole is getting
much better at driving the old robot, and our knowledge of the rules is steadily increasing. We managed to remount the control panel on the
new robot chassis, and were able to get the new robot up and driving for a few minutes with a simple program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunatley, the end of the build didn't go as smoothly as the beginning. We ended up getting a lot done, but one
of the Jaguars controlling the drive motors gave out and left our robot immobilized. It was a minor setback, however; and after installing a new
Jaguar we are good to go. The programming team also got to test their prototype program, and after we smooth out a few errors we should be in
good working order.</p>

<h2 id="newstitle">Build #6-10</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 31 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of prototyping and debugging since the last update. On the other hand, there hasn't been much news from each build, so
this post should recap what has happend pretty well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two bases, one for prototyping, the other for driving, our old robot is still being practices with as well. Our shooting mechanism
is working well now. We may create a test harness at the next build for it to standardize the shots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control panel for this year was mounted and and is being adjusted. We will be using a more modular approach for some of our control
system, the Jaguars contolling the drive motors are on their drive assemblies. The programming team has, with the assistance of Dr. Cherba, fixed the console errors
we've been receiving. It appears that the basic controls will be done by the end of the build Wednesday, assuming the control panel is finished for a quick test run.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 19 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday's build time was spent focusing on the robot's ball shooting mechanism. We experimented with methods of targeting the baskets and
with our new type of shooting mechanism, and we have been making some good progress with our accuracy and range. The team experimented with our old robot to get a feel
for how we are going to balance this years robot on the bridges. It turned out to be a difficult process to do manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday we focused mainly on getting our new temporary control laptop set up with all the needed drivers and software. While waiting, Caleb taught a group of us
the basic workings of HTML code, and we are starting to get the hang of it. The rest of the team also worked on designs for the ball retreival mechanism, and began building
a prototype. Toward the end of the build session, we began to plan and draw out the logical control layout for all the robot's needed commands and feedback.</p>

<div class="titlebanner">
<h2 id="newstitle">Build #3</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 15 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we finished setting up the classmate for competition. It appears that we will be unable to use the Kinect on the classmate due to
hard drive size restrictions. We are considering purchasing or trying to aquire a different netbook, like we used last year. We did try out the Kinect on one of our
development computers though, and it worked pretty well.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assembled the frame for this years robot. It isn't done yet, but we tested its ability to get on the ramp. We found that we will
have to move the bumpers higher up on the robot. We also assemled and tested a prototype shooting mechanism. We used hand drills to power the wheels, and found that
we needed the wheels to spin faster and have more power. We will attempt to test them with the CIM motor(s) next week.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the day, we drove last year's robot onto the bridge. It is very dificult to balance the robot because the bridge gets a lot of momentum
at the tipping point. We will see if we can get it to balance using a gyro in the controls instead.</p>

<h2 id="newstitle">Build #2</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 11 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meeting was very productive. Our control panel has been updated, even though the included imaging USB wouldn't work, FIRST's new
set up instructions worked perfectly. The balance bridge is now done and has passed the official weight test.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We disscussed how we would launch the balls into the hoops. We will spend part of Saturday prototyping the new method until we feel it matches
the competition standard.</p>

<div class="titlebanner">
<h2 id="newstitle">Build #1</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 9 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we revised our strategy due to several rules we found while we individualy read the entire manual over the weekend. Driving a robot
along its width should make balancing three robots during the end game easier. At first we only recognized the need for two robots on any bridge, but with additional
points during the eliminations rounds, it was clear that the three would be necessary.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of our meeting was spent creating game elements for practice. As we won't take apart our last year's robot, we will have the chance to
practice while assebling the new one. We have the backboards completed and are close to finishing a balance bridge.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 8 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, our team attended the 2012 kickoff event at GVSU's downtown campus. We got
down to business analyzing the game, checking the kit of parts, and brainstorming. After the full 8-3:30 day,
we have decided on a few strategies that we are going to prototype. We also choose the base configuration so that
it can be assembled as soon as possible. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking forward to Monday: our first build day, our yearbook pictures day, and the
day we will begin to sort through all of the software updates.</p>

<h2 id="newstitle">New Year, New Season</h2>
</div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">January. 1 2012</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy New Year! Its only a few days to the official start of our new season. We have been trying to recruit new members and sponsors for the
past few weeks though so that we might be prepared for the new season. It looks like we might have a full team, but we will probably continue our sponsor hunting for
a while longer.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We haven't yet moved into our new build location, but we hope to be there soon!</p>
