newsc='As a first news article, and as one of my last contributions to the website, I thought I would explain whats done and whats yet to go in regard to website development and publication.<br /><br />As to text, all you need to do is email me at zacharydebruine@gmail.com with a complete text for every page AND an attached photo that will go on the website; every page should work and has a brief description of what will be featured.  My brother, Nathan, has volunteered to insert all the text and photos into the webpage.  Perhaps this is the best way, since if any technical issues arise, I will already be here to answer them.<br /><br />The FRC Question of the Day Gadget is going to be a little work.  My brother is going to go through the FRC manual and try to pick out appropriate questions, however, they are more than welcome from anyone.  Simply email them to me.  Questions should be concise short enough to fit inside the gadget.  They can be either multiple choice (5 choices), thumbnail photo selection (4choices), or free response.<br /><br />The photo gallery is going to demand the most work.  Nathan will actually take care of this, but is not willing to go through photos.  I need 7-15 high-quality photos per archive (archives are 2010 and 2011 Build Season, 2010 Competitions and 2011 Competitions) all sent to Caleb Pratt so he can upload them to his picasa account.  From there Nathan will put them on the website directory.<br /><br />I will be updating this news file regularly, so please keep an eye on what needs to get done.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:120%;">P.S.:  the next news article should be about our current robot status and construction.  Who wants to submit this news article?  Lets get our team work published!</span>';
