- adjustments to the logout parameters of the forum required playing around w/ phpBB's code, in case of future updates:
	- open lowellrobotics.org/forum/ucp.php
	- adjust ~line 95 "meta_refresh(3, append_sid("{$phpbb_root_path}index.$phpEx"));"
	- it should be changed to "meta_refresh(1, "/"); // Redirects to site index on logout"
