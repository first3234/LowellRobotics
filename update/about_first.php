<h3 style="width:795px;">What is FIRST?</h3>
<img src="common/about_first.png" style="margin:5px;border:#000000 1px solid;float:right;" alt="Our Website" />FIRST (For Inspiration of Science and Technology) is an organization committed, in the words of founder Dean Kamen, "To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders."  FIRST was founded in 1989 with this mission and has since evolved into an immense program influencing the lives of over 250,000 students worldwide!  FIRST aims to inspire these young people to lead careers in science and technology by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs which will build science, demand innovation, and equip them to succeed in their future endeavors by developing skills that encourage communication, teamwork, leadership, and self-confidence.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Woodie Flowers, the FIRST National Advisor, describes the excellent attitude desired of all students--high-quality work, emphasizing the value of others, respecting individuals and the community--as "Gracious Professionalism".  FIRST inspires students to learn and compete at full-throttle, but it also reminds them by Gracious Professionalism to treat one another with respect and generosity.  As a product of this gracious behavior, the FIRST concept of Coopertition will be realized.  Coopertition involves learning from everybody, and paying back what you've learned to everybody.  It involves helping and cooperating with other teams even as you compete against them.

<h3 style="width:795px;">What is FRC?</h3>
The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a program of FIRST encompassing over 2,200 teams which embody more than 55,000 high-school students.  The annual game challenge is released on the first weekend of January, at "Kickoff".  Teams then enter "Build Season", a 6-week period during which a robot must be prototyped, designed, constructed, and programmed to participate in the competitions.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, the FIRST Robotics Competition was held for the first time in a high school gym in New Hampshire.  In the game, "Maize Craze", Robots had to go around the gym and pick up corn to BETTER DESCRIPTION.  In contrast, this years game, "Logomotion", will be hosted worldwide, eventually culminating in the World Competition at St. Louis.<br />
