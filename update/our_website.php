<img src="common/our_website.png" style="margin:5px;border:#000000 1px solid;float:right;" alt="Our Website" />When I tell most people that I'm going to double-major in Chemical Engineering and Bioinformatics and then tell them that I just finished designing a webpage, they look at me quizzically and ask, "What's the correlation"?  I don't even try to explain most of the time, I just say "they are both lots of fun".  What most people don't realize, however, is that computers have become such an important part of everyday life no matter where we are that computer illiteracy almost predicts poor performance in nearly any career, particularly those in the sciences.  To successfully thrive in our microchip-networked academic and business communities, we need to understand computers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I set to designing this webpage.  I teamed up in particular with two other students on the team -- Ben Veltman and Caleb Pratt.  After joining forces, and receiving lots of cooperation and assistance from the remainder of the team, we saw it's publication.  Here's some of the facts about the webpage...

We are firm believers in originality.  Everything on this website was written from scratch in Notepad.  All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is entirely designed by myself or by other team members.  We designed our webpage using the XHTML 1.0-Strict doctype.  All our XHTML codes are entirely W3C-validated, as well as our CSS external stylesheets.  We place the vast majority of our JavaScripts externally.  We have created scripts to do anything from enabling easy photo gallery browsing to displaying quick and simple drop-down menus to the complex Question of the Day Google Gadget.  Our Question of the Day Google Gadget was written in entirely valid XML, also featuring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as CDATA within the XML file.<br /><br />

Passion for web design seems to be contagious.  Once the conversation starts, the entire team gets talking about PHP versus ASP, .gif photo extensions as opposed to .png and .jpeg, valid and invalid HTML 5.0, and even how you could help YouTube fix their invalid and outdated video embed features (though it never did happen).  It's really been an excellent learning experience for the whole team -- we've all benefited greatly from this project.  As I hand the reins over to the next student in line, I'm happy to know that it's now their chance to learn it all.<br /><br />
