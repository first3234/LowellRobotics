<p>We are very sorry for this inconvenience.  This page is currently in the creation process, and we are hoping to publish it by <b>January 31, 2011</b>.  This page will give a description of what our team is doing, based on "build season", "pre-competition", "competitions", "post-season", or "gearing-up".  Remember, each page will need one nice photo!  Email it to zacharydebruine@gmail.com and my brother will post it.</p>
